            I am 32 years old. I have been working as a policeman for 10 years. I have never had office work,I want to make money
            with my brain but not with my body. Nevertheless this job allowed me to get high education at Dnipro state University of
            Internal Affairs,so it was useful expirience. But I want to move forward. I want to do something new and challenging.
            Moreover I tried programming,I fell in love and I want to work in this sphere. In 2017 I dedicided to start learning
            English,because I want to change my job.. I am single. My parents live in Dnipro and I have two yanger brothers.
            Personal qualities: ambitious, qick-leaner, diligent, enjoy challenges, responsible, persistent, stress resistant,
            flexible, communicable. I like a cars, I like travelling and learning something new. Thats all.
